# facebook-profile-post-reader
##Reads posts of (public) Facebook profiles##
A (very) simple reader that allows you to read posts of (public) pofiles.
The data is written into into a MySQL table.  
  
Remember to edit the config.php file :)  
  
Start the reader by calling the readFBfeeds.php file  
The code is quite old and might need some adjustments to fit OOP standards  
You need to be registered as a Facebook developer to get the FB App credentials
